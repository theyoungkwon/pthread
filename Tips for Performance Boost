Tips for Performance Boost
1. 1D Long Array => reduce memory access!!
(did not conduct many experiments for comparison but checked few cases and it is useful.)

2. reduce function call especially createSugar & createPeople
=>reduce creating and deleting stacks with function creation overhead!!

3. Many Execution in a For Loop
In createPeople & createSugar functions,
increase # of execution in For loop => reduce branch overhead!!
(did not conduct many experiments for comparison but checked few cases and it is useful.)

4. USE Register as an iterator variable!!
=> declaring iterator as a register increase huge amount of performance & speed.
=> But the thing is you can only use 2 variables as a register in 1 function.

5. Avoid Mutex lock as much as you can.
=> mutex lock make most of the bottle neck ocurred in parallel computing envirnment from best of my experience.
===========================================
REMINDER
1. implement the code based on 1 main and 4 sub task functions format.
such as main with peopleMove, peopleMergeAndEat, createPeople, createSugar
=> but in this format, we need to create and join threads. Creating and destroying
threads would be costly operation.
=> Thus, just creating certain number of threads at the beginning of the program and then have a barrier instead of destroying them.
this approach would be more effient in terms of speed.
